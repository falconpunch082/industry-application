# Consumer Behaviour Analysis with Power BI Dashboards

## Purpose of Project
This project serves to show my capability to adopt a new tool and add it to my skillset; I demonstrated such ability by learning how to use the popular data visualisation and transformation tool Power BI.

One of the important things about running a company providing products is to understand its customers, whether it is through direct feedback or understanding the audience through statistics. By understanding its customers, companies are better prepared to create products that attract their audience and therefore bring in more revenue. It is also useful in deciding where to expand operations, and whether their current way of working is beneficial and/or sustainable in the long run.

Dashboards were made using 2023 annual customer data from Slay Clothing, a fictional clothing company. The aim of these dashboards is to better inform the stakeholders of Slay Clothing of the types of customers they are attracting, what products are selling, revenue gained for each subtype, and the impact of price changing tactics such as discounts, promo codes and membership on number of purchases.

## Data Collection
Data was collected from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset). Please refer to documentation attached in linked website to further understand variables within the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis was done on Power BI immediately, as the data was clean enough to work with. However, within Power BI, additional columns such as age range and review rating bings were added to provide more digestable data visualisations. Other than that, no other changes were done.

## Dashboards
Two dashboards were created, each with their own focus. The dashboards can be easily accessed over [here](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/d9f5d18c-852c-48e5-a75f-edf8367f8b21/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)!

### Dashboard 1: Demographic Impact

This dashboard showcased the distribution of customer age, gender and location, alongside popular items and method of payment. Total revenue earned, average shopping cart total and number of transactions done are visible as cards in this dashboard. This dashboard is clickable, and every click will change the visualisations in the dashboard. For example, if someone were to click on the female proportion of the pie chart, the visualisations will change to show what female customers bought, how much they contributed, etc.

### Dashboard 2: Consumer Behaviour

This dashboard showcased the impact of the presence of discounts, promo codes, and subscription status on how customers spent their money on products. This dashboard also showcased which seasons and colour were popular. Like the first dashboard, it is interactive; it also features a search filter of age and gender should one would like to see demographic impacts on consumer behaviour and preferences.
